You also need to compile the two softwares in src/MDS and src/PM, and place
them in the directory of your choice.

1) First install IPOPT: https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt
IPOPT can be installed anywhere, you will have to tell "3dmodel" where IPOPT
is.
2) The "3dmodel" directory can be anywhere you like. 
3) You have to edit the file Makefile, and set the following 3 variables at
the
top: IPOPTPATH, IPOPTINCDIR, IPOPTLIBDIR.
